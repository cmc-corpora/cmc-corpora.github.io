Achille is a linguistic data engineer, mainly invested in corpora. He collects, formats, parses and annotates linguistic corpora; but he is also eager to provide tools that let all kind of language professionals access and use them easily, whether they are linguists, teachers or translators. He has a liking for corpora of spontaneous and "natural" writing, such as online chats, popular writing in general, but also classical texts older than normative grammars, which allow for the study the natural flow of language evolution across time.
