Jennifer has been working on the creation and analysis of various cmc and other non-standard language corpora (e.g. learner corpora, corpora of student essays). She has gathered vast experience in technical, legal and methodological issues concerning the collection, creation, analysis and publication of cmc corpora, using her skills in computer science, AI and NLP as well as statistics. 
Her interdisciplinary approach, that originated in her study background, is complemented by broad interests in language varieties, literacy development, language learning and teaching, but also media literacy and technology-enhanced learning. After studying German language and computer science for a teacher's degree in Graz, Austria, she worked several years in corpus linguistic projects at the Institute for Applied Linguistics at Eurac Research and recently finished her PhD at the University of Bologna, where she investigated machine-learning approaches for the analysis of German non-standard corpora.
