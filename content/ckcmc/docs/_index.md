We offer expertise on language resources and technologies for Computer-Mediated
Communication and Social Media Corpora.  We can be contacted via email to
`contact-ckcmc @ CLARIN DOT EU`.  There, we offer additional clarifications
regarding this documentation and support in using, modifying, producing, or
publishing CMC resources and technologies.  For more general questions, also
consider joining the [European group of researchers interested in the
development and processing of CMC corpora @ Google

the two central topics of our K-centre:
