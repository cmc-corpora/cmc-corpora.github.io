[Jožef Stefan Institute](https://www.ijs.si/ijsw/V001/JSI) is the leading
research institution for natural sciences in Slovenia having over 900
researchers within 25 departments working in the areas of computer science,
physics, and chemistry and biology.

The [Department of Knowledge Technologies](http://kt.ijs.si/) has a staff of 35
researchers and 15 PhD students and external collaborators. The Department
performs research in advanced information technologies aimed at acquiring,
storing and managing knowledge to be used in the development of an information-
and knowledge-based society. Established areas of our work include intelligent
data analysis (machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery in
databases), computational creativity, decision support
and knowledge management.

The Department is also a recognised centre of research on language
technologies, computational linguistics, corpus linguistic, and digital
humanities. It has been involved in the compilation of the majority of existing
Slovene mono- and multilingual corpora, the development of manually annotated
corpora for training language annotation tools, the development of the tools,
such as part-of-speech taggers, lemmatisers, parsers and named entity
recognisers and in work on standardisation of linguistic encoding in the scope
of TEI and ISO. The department is also the home of the Slovene research
infrastructure [CLARIN.SI](https://www.clarin.si), a member of the [CLARIN
ERIC](https://clarin.eu).
