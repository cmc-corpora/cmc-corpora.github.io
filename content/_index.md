        ### The CMC-Corpora Conference Series
        A series of conferences dedicated to the collection, annotation, processing, and
        analysis of corpora of computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media
        corpora.

        ### The CLARIN K(nowledge)-Centre for Computer-Mediated Communication and Social Media Corpora (CKCMC)
        A dedicated to questions about representation, standardisation and
        distribution of CMC Corpora.

      title: CMC
      subtitle: Computer-Mediated Communication
      text: |
        Communication between humans via networked devices has become an everyday part
        of people’s lives across different generations, cultures, geographical areas,
        and social classes. Shaped by the specific social and technical context in
        which it is produced, synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated
        communication (CMC) has become increasingly participatory, interactive, and
        multimodal. 
        It constitutes public and private communication on-line, such as posts on
        blogs, forums, comments on online news sites, social media and networking sites
        such as Twitter and Facebook, mobile phone applications such as WhatsApp,
        e-mail and chat rooms. 

        All this user-generated CMC and social media content offers a wide range of
        research opportunities for a growing multidisciplinary research community to
        examine themes that often relate to—but are not limited to—the interaction
        between language, CMC, and society like, for example, language variation,
        pragmatics, media and communication studies. The data is also very important
        for the development of robust NLP tools that can deal with non-standard
        spelling, vocabulary and grammar. 
        Compilation and dissemination of such corpora are hindered by the unclear legal
        status of CMC data when distributed as resource to the scientific community,
        which is further exacerbated by the rapidly changing terms of service by
        content providers.

        The ambition of this still-growing research community is for the research into
        CMC to be based on the availability of large, structured data sets, as is the
        case for many scientific communities. These data sets (corpora) are often built
        collaboratively from the work of different research teams and disseminated
        across the research community so that they may form the basis for new analyses
        and comparative or counter-analyses. With this in mind, in the mid-2000s, a
        growing number of projects started to collect and structure CMC corpora and
        diffuse these empirical resources that cover a broad range of CMC genres and
        languages to both the wider scientific community and business enterprises that
        develop approaches and tools for web mining, opinion and trend detection,
        semantic content analysis, or machine translation.
