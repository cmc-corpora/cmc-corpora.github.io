abstract: 'Following the excellent exchange at prior editions of the CMC-conference series, we are delighted to
present the proceedings of the 12th edition of the ‚International Conference on Computer-Mediated
Communication and Social Media Corpora’ (CMC2025). The conference mainly focuses on data
collection, annotation, and corpus analysis from computer-mediated communication and social media.
The conference also provides a framework for scientific exchange on methods of data processing and
sustainable data infrastructures.
The CMC 2025 would like to serve the CMC-community to investigate a wide range of languagecentered studies in Computer-Mediated Communication and social media, drawing from linguistics,
philology, communication sciences and data science, with research questions stemming from corpus
and computational linguistics, computational science, language technology, text technology, and
machine learning. This year CMC-edition also enables exchange between the aforementioned
disciplines on the one hand and data sciences as well as social sciences in general on the other. In
addition, keeping up with social and language change, this conference also highlights communicationrelated questions of social and linguistic-related diversity, participation, and inclusion. The 12th
Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora is held at the Chair of German Linguistics at the
University of Bayreuth (Germany) on September 4th and 5th 2025.
This volume includes two keynote papers, 18 accepted talk papers, and the abstracts of the 16 posters
presented at CMC 2025 in Bayreuth. Each contribution underwent an anonymous double peer-review
process by scientists at the CMC-scientific committee. The contributions will be presented in two
sessions (including poster presentations) and in plenum. The talks and the poster presentations discuss
a broad range of topics, ranging from CMC-corpus construction to corpus analysis including
methodological discussions and inter- and multidisciplinary co-operation with other scientific fields
essential to research on Computer-Mediated Communication.
The two keynote talks are held by Prof. Dr. Stephanie Evert (Friedrich-Alexander-University of
Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany) and Dr. Gavin Brookes (Lancaster University).'
