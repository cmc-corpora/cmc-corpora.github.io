abstract: 'Following the great success of the tenth conference held in Mannheim, Germany, in 2023, we are very pleased to present the proceedings of the eleventh edition of the International Conference on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and Social Media Corpora (CMC2024). The main focus of the conference is to explore the collection, annotation, processing, and analysis of corpora from computer-mediated communication and social media.

Our general aim is to serve as the meeting place for a wide range of language-oriented investigations into CMC and social media, drawing from linguistics, philology, communication sciences, media studies and foreign language teaching and learning, with research questions stemming from corpus and computational linguistics, language technology, text technology, and machine learning.

The 11th Conference on CMC and Social Media Corpora was held at the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme et de la Société Sud-Est (MSHS) on September 5th and 6th at the University Côte d’Azur in Nice, France. This volume contains 19 accepted papers and the abstracts of the 13 posters presented at the event. Each submission was reviewed by the members of the scientific committee. The contributions were presented across three sessions with two parallel streams, along with a poster session. They cover a broad range of topics, from corpus construction to analysis, including the methods employed in that context.

The program also included two invited talks: an international keynote by Susan Herring (Indiana University, USA), who did us the great honor of attending in person, on the pros and cons of upscaling the model of Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis she developed; and a national keynote by Marco Cappellini (University of Lyon 1) on corpora in telecollaboration and virtual exchange. This volume contains the abstracts of the invited talks. Additionally, the conference featured a community-building and metadata session, and participants were invited to attend two training workshops on Inception and Iramuteq'
