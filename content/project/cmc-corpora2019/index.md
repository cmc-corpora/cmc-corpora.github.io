'CMC-Corpora 2019' was the 7th edition of an annual conference series dedicated
to the collection, annotation, processing and exploitation of corpora of
computer-mediated communication (CMC) and social media for research in the
humanities. The conference brought together language-centered research on CMC
and social media in linguistics, philologies, communication sciences, media and
social sciences with research questions from the fields of corpus and
computational linguistics, language technology, text technology, and machine
learning.
